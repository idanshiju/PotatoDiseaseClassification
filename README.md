# 🥔 Potato Disease Classification

A Deep Learning-based image classification project that identifies potato leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow and Keras.

This project was developed as part of hands-on learning in deep learning, model training, image preprocessing, and deployment using FastAPI.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images of potato leaves into different categories of disease using a custom-trained CNN model. The model can be served via an API using FastAPI, making it accessible for real-world applications like mobile or web-based disease detection tools.
